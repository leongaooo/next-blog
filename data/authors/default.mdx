Hello! I'm Leon Gao, my Chinese name is 高立民.
Currently, I am focusing on the Web3D field, while also interested in GIS geographic development. In my spare time, I make efforts to learn English and study full-stack development.

Since I got into Web development in 2021, I haven't changed my career path or inner passion. This is driven by the thriving front-end community and the continuous evolution of HTTP. We've witnessed an expanding range of possibilities within browsers—technologies like WebAssembly, WebRTC, and WebGL are truly exciting.

Now I am concentrating on creating excellent and avant-garde web front-end applications, while keeping a close eye on graphic rendering technologies such as Web3D. If you share the same interests, we will definitely have a lot in common.
