Hello! I'm Leon Gao, my Chinese name is 高立民.

I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions at the intersection of full-stack development and 3D visualization. Here are some of my key projects that showcase this passion:

**[SVG to 2.5D Converter](https://github.com/leongaooo/SvgToThreeModel)** - A Vue 3 and Three.js powered tool that transforms SVG floor plans into immersive 2.5D wall models while preserving text elements. Perfect for architectural visualization and bringing 2D blueprints to life.

**[MindPilot](https://github.com/Amzing-Ai/mind-pilot)** - An AI-driven task management and personal growth system that redefines how we approach daily productivity. Built with cutting-edge AI integration to help users achieve their goals more effectively.

**[Cesium-Kit](https://github.com/leongaooo/cesium-kit)** - An open-source TypeScript toolkit for Cesium.js, providing plug-and-play functions and utilities for rapid 3D geospatial development. Essential for anyone working with geographic data visualization and interactive maps.

My journey in web development since 2021 has been driven by the incredible possibilities emerging in browsers - from WebAssembly and WebRTC to WebGL and beyond. I'm continuously exploring the frontiers of full-stack development and 3D graphics, always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers who share a passion for innovative web technologies, 3D visualization, and building the future of interactive experiences. Let's create something amazing together!
